# Security Checklist

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:

1. **STOP immediately**
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

## Common Issues to Catch

### Security

- Hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- SQL injection (string concatenation in queries)
- XSS vulnerabilities (unescaped user input)
- Path traversal (unsanitized file paths)
- CSRF protection missing
- Authentication bypasses

### Code Quality

- Large functions (>50 lines) - split into smaller
- Large files (>800 lines) - extract modules
- Deep nesting (>4 levels) - use early returns
- Missing error handling - handle explicitly
- Mutation patterns - prefer immutable operations
- Missing tests - add test coverage

### Performance

- N+1 queries - use JOINs or batching
- Missing pagination - add LIMIT to queries
- Unbounded queries - add constraints
- Missing caching - cache expensive operations
